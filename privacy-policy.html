  <h1>Privacy Policy for "What's That Course?"</h1>

  <p>Welcome to "What's That Course?" (the "Extension"). This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our Extension. Your privacy is important to us, and we are committed to protecting it. By using the Extension, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>

  <h2>2. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
  <p>We want to make it clear that "What's That Course?" does not collect, store, or share any personal data from its users. Specifically:</p>
  <ul>

    <li><strong>No Cookies</strong>: We do not use cookies or similar tracking technologies to gather information about your online activities.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. How the Extension Works</h2>
  <p>The primary function of "What's That Course?" is to provide the titles of Cornell University courses when their codes are highlighted on any webpage. The Extension processes the highlighted course codes locally on your device and retrieves course information directly from the Cornell Class Roster. This process does not involve sending any data to external servers.</p>

  <h2>4. Permissions</h2>
  <p>To provide the intended functionality, the Extension requires certain permissions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Storage</strong>: To store course data and the state of the course detection process locally on your device.</li>
    <li><strong>ContextMenus</strong>: To add a custom context menu item that allows you to search for course titles.</li>
    <li><strong>Scripting</strong>: To inject scripts into web pages for detecting and highlighting course codes.</li>
    <li><strong>ActiveTab</strong>: To access the content of the currently active tab when you interact with the Extension.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These permissions are solely used to enable the features of the Extension and are not used to collect or transmit any data.</p>

  <h2>5. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make any changes, we will notify you by updating the Effective Date at the top of this policy. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed about how we are protecting your information.</p>
